    <div class="about-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            When you enter Mana’s domain—whether to browse her collections or buy a cursed t-shirt—we may collect info such as your name, email, shipping address, and payment details. Fear not, dear Imp. Your soul is not part of the package… yet.

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">2. How We Use Your Info</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is used to deliver your orders, send updates (when something wicked is released), and improve the site experience. Mana hates spam as much as poorly mixed vocals, so you'll only get relevant hellish updates.
        </p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">3. Data Protection Runes</h2>
        <p>
            We use digital wards (aka encryption and secure protocols) to protect your data from digital demons and other evildoers. Your information will never be sold to third parties—Mana guards her Imps fiercely.
        </p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">4. Cookies (Not the Sweet Kind)</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, cookies are used—but only the helpful kind. They help us remember you between visits and summon you to the right pages. You may disable them, but beware: some parts of Mana's lair may not function properly.
        </p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">5. Your Rights in the Abyss</h2>
        <p>
            You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. If you have faced any kind of problem, just summon the Admin Imp (aka contact us), and your request will be handled with great respect—and possibly a minor ritual.
